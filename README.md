EchoAssist: Real-Time AI Customer Service for Small Businesses
Inspiration
Small business owners constantly juggle multiple responsibilities, with customer service often falling by the wayside due to limited resources. We recognized this pain point and saw an opportunity to leverage modern AI technology to provide an affordable solution that levels the playing field for small businesses competing against larger corporations with dedicated support teams.

What it does
EchoAssist transforms a small business's website and knowledge base into an intelligent voice assistant that handles customer phone inquiries in real-time. By integrating Twilio's telephony capabilities with advanced language models, our system answers product questions, provides business information, and handles basic customer service tasks without human intervention.

How we built it
We developed a streamlined system where business owners simply connect their website and upload relevant business materials. Our backend processes this information to create a knowledge base that powers the AI assistant. We implemented:

A web scraper to extract business information from websites
A vector database to store and efficiently retrieve business knowledge
Integration with large language models for natural conversation handling
Twilio's telephony API to manage incoming/outgoing calls
Speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion for seamless voice interaction

Additionally, handling the wide variety of customer inquiries while maintaining context throughout conversations required significant prompt engineering.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully created an end-to-end system that allows any small business to have an AI-powered phone assistant up and running in minutes rather than months. Our solution requires no technical exp
